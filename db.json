Rather than focusing on intense ripe fruit, this Cab offers complexity through secondary characteristics brought forth by skillful winemaking. Fermentation takes place in open concrete tanks to preserve varietal character. During fermentation, the winemakers regulate the temperature and do frequent punch downs of the hard cap to increase flavor integration and texture. Once fermentation is complete, the wine is transferred to 300-liter French oak barrels, where it is left to mature for a minimum of 12 months. Posted Accord believes in a harmonious union that blends excellence and imagination, and we believe this Cabernet is just that.",

                "description": "With its mountainous, maritime-influenced winegrowing regions, South Africa produces top-quality Cabernet Sauvignon and Chenin Blanc and premium Syrah, Pinotage, Chardonnay and Sauvignon Blanc. The Dutch brought vines here back in the 1600s to satiate their thirsty sailors en route to India, but they probably never imagined just how important to the wine world South Africa would one day become. Indeed, it took centuries for South Africa to discover its full potential. Most of the country's winegrowing areas thrive in the southwest, known as the Western Cape. Its most famous regions are an easy drive from Cape Town and include Stellenbosch, Swartland, Breedekloof and Franschhoek. ",

Beautifully balanced and approachable, this delightful wine comes from the Lake Garda DOC in northern Italy. Here, vineyards line the bright green hills dotted with olive groves, and single lane roads lined with cypress trees wind through the picturesque landscape. The region's Mediterranean climate provides a long, warm growing season. Chilly winds from off the lake rustle the vine's canopy and provide relief from high temperatures. This allows the Pinot Grigio grapes enough time to ripen and develop rich flavors while retaining their natural acidity. This textural wine is refreshing on its own but also makes a fantastic pair with lighter pasta dishes and creamy cheeses. For ideal enjoyment, serve well chilled on sunlight patios shared with good friends and scenic landscapes. \u003cb\u003eScroll through the image carousel above to learn more about this wine.\u003c/b\u003e\u003c/p\u003e",

                "description": "Nowhere inspires romance quite like Italy's Lake Garda. Its eastern shores merge into the beautifully terraced hillsides of Verona, where vines meet cypress, olive, cherry, and citrus groves. Chardonnay is the most planted variety here, soaking in the warm Mediterranean sun and developing fine acids and aromatics in the cool Alpine air. Garganega (the grape of nearby Soave) also thrives, as does Riesling and northeast Italy's ubiquitous Pinot Grigio. Garda's famous light reds—Valpolicella and Bardolina—are made principally from the local Corvina grape. Other outstanding Garda wines include Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc and Merlot. The DOC (Denominazione di Origine Controllata) designation for Italian wines was introduced in the 1960s. It is the main classification system used in the country and regulates what winemakers can and cannot do regarding wine style, varietal restrictions, minimum and maximum alcohol levels, aging techniques and growing regions.",

Embracing the Mediterranean from Spain to Provence, this region is famed as much for its Grenache, Pinot Noir and Chardonnay as its endless sunshine. Pays d'Oc covers non-AOC wines made across this large, sun-kissed region, known as France's \"New World.\" Far from the regulations of the AOC system, pioneering winemakers headed here to experiment, crafting many now-famous wines that often state their grape variety on the label—not something that was common in France before then. IGP (Indication Géographique Protégée) within France’s wine classification system focuses on controlling regional and geographical origin. The category is less restrictive than the AOC classification and gives winemakers more freedom with style and taste profile when creating wines.",

Chanmé Méchant is a playful French \"verlan\" — a word that flip flops its sound to create a phrase that captures opposites. Chanmé meaning enjoyable; Méchant meaning a bit wicked. Together they make for an approachable and informal expression of French varietals."
